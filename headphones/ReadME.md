This project showcases a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu implemented using only HTML and CSS. It adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and operates without JavaScript, providing a clean and efficient solution for responsive design.

Features
The navigation bar includes a responsive design that adjusts for both desktop and mobile screens. On larger screens, the navigation links are displayed horizontally, while on smaller screens, they are hidden and replaced by a hamburger menu. Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the menu, revealing the navigation links in a vertical layout.

The solution relies solely on CSS, utilizing the :checked pseudo-class for toggling the menu. It ensures an accessible and simple user interface with semantic HTML.

File Structure
The project consists of two primary files:

index.html contains the structure for the navigation bar, including a hidden checkbox for toggling the menu, a label for the hamburger icon, and a list of navigation links.
styles.css defines the styles for the navigation bar, hamburger menu, and responsive behaviors using a media query.
